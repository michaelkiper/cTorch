# Torch.c

Hello, this repo is my attempt at implementing a version of [PyTorch's autograd](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/introyt/autogradyt_tutorial.html) written in C. The objective of this is to both get better at my C programming and to better understand the fundamentals of autograd.

#### Note
1. I am extremely bad and new to C. A lot of things I am learning for the first time. Imagine a 5th grader trying to write code, and this is what it will be like.
2. I will write this repo for the purposes of functionality, not optimality or efficiecny. If it works, it ships.
3. Criticism is welcome :)
